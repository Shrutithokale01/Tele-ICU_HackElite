# Intel Unnati Industrial Training Program
# Problem Statement - Innovative Monitoring System for TeleICU Patients using Video Processing and Deep learning
## INTRODUCTION - 

•	TeleICU is concept for monitoring ICU patients from remote locations to reduce the burden of on-site intensivist. 

•	The proposed solution should work to reduce the burden of remote health care professional so, one remote health care professional can monitor 5 or more patients at single time.

## OBJECTIVES – 

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate monitoring system for TeleICU settings, focusing on two key aspects:

•	Object Detection: Train a deep learning model to accurately identify various individuals present in the ICU room, including Nurses, Doctors and Patients. This will help in ensuring proper care and monitoring of patient interactions.

•	Patient Motion Recognition: Develop a deep learning model to recognize and categorize different activities of the patient when they are alone. This includes monitoring for signs of distress, abnormal movements, and other critical activities that require immediate attention.

## AIM –

•	Enhance patient safety through continuous and automated monitoring.

•	Assist healthcare providers in timely intervention and decision-making.

•	Improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of ICU operations.
