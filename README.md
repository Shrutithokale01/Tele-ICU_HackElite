# Intel Unnati Industrial Training Program üöÄ
## Problem Statement - Innovative Monitoring System for TeleICU Patients using Video Processing and Deep learning
### INTRODUCTION üè•- 

- TeleICU is concept for monitoring ICU patients from remote locations to reduce the burden of on-site intensivist.
- The proposed solution should work to reduce the burden of remote health care professional so, one remote health care professional can monitor 5 or more patients at single time.

### OBJECTIVES üéØ‚Äì 

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate monitoring system for TeleICU settings, focusing on two key aspects:

- Object Detection: Train a deep learning model to accurately identify various individuals present in the ICU room, including Nurses, Doctors and Patients. This will help in ensuring proper care and monitoring of patient interactions.
- Patient Motion Recognition: Develop a deep learning model to recognize and categorize different activities of the patient when they are alone. This includes monitoring for signs of distress, abnormal movements, and other critical activities that require immediate attention.

### AIM ü•Ö‚Äì

- Enhance patient safety through continuous and automated monitoring.
- Assist healthcare providers in timely intervention and decision-making.
- Improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of ICU operations.

### Key features üîê-

1. Real-time Object and Motion Detection üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è:   Identifies individuals (doctors, nurses, patients) and recognizes patient activities using integrated deep learning models.


2. Patient Motion Recognition ü§ñ:  Recognizes and categorizes different patient activities when they are alone or with others presence, including signs of distress and abnormal movements, using mediapipe. (Detected Motion - Eyes, mouth, head & hands)

3. Automated Alerts üö®:  Triggers sound alerts for immediate intervention when patient motion is detected. (exception : when there is any movement in the bounding box of patient, motion will be detected and alert will be generated)

4. User-friendly GUI üñ•Ô∏è:  Intuitive interface for video selection, processing, and viewing detected frames.

#### Calculation -> 

##### Frames per Second, inference & Accuracy :

Total number of frames are 723 of the video of 24 seconds then how many frames per second ?

- fps=video¬†length¬†in¬†seconds total¬†frames‚Äã
Given:
Total frames = 1538
Video length = 50 seconds
Let's do the calculation:
fps=1538 / 50 ‚âà 30.76

So, the video has approximately 30.76 frames per second.

- Inference - 839.6 ms -----ÔÉ† 0.8396 seconds 

- Accuracy - 80 % to 90 %



## Tools and Technologies üõ†Ô∏è :


- Object Detection Models: YOLOv8
- Development environment (IDE): Pycharm, Jupyter
- Motion Recognition/ tracking: mediapipe
- Data Annotation Tools: roboflow
- Video Processing Libraries: OpenCV
- GUI: Tkinter
- Other: Pygame, numpy, os

## Unique Idea Brief üí°-

### OUR APPROACH:

We have taken 2-3 videos of the ICU Room .
To work on the video and to detect the functionality of the patient , we first created the dataset using ROBOFLOW - which mainly include set of data‚Äôs for (Doctors, Nurse and  Patient)
Now we have used three different deep learning and video processing techniques and models to build our project

ÔÅ±	     Object Detection Model

ÔÅ±	     Motion detecttion(yes or no) model

ÔÅ±	     Keypoint detection + alerting model

Then we have integrated the three models in order to simplify user experience.
Then we have also included the GUI where the user need to select the saved video and then process that video to get the integrated model working on the video.

## PREREQUISITES üìã-

(To run '3 model integrated + GUI.py') follow the steps given below-

1. Install necessary libraries.
```bash
pip install ultralytics
pip install jupyterlab
pip install mediapipe
pip install opencv-python
pip install pygame
pip install numpy
```

3. Download high resolution mp4 ICU room videos provided.
4. Download Audio file [Audiofile.mp3](https://github.com/Shrutithokale01/Tele-ICU_HackElite/blob/main/Audiofile.mp3) provided.
5. Create an Output folder to save detected frames.

## In Pycharm or Jupyter

1. Clone the code [3 model integrated + GUI.py](https://github.com/Shrutithokale01/Tele-ICU_HackElite/blob/main/3%20model%20integrated%20%2B%20GUI.py).
2. Importing libraries.
3. Adjust the path of [best.pt](https://github.com/Shrutithokale01/Tele-ICU_HackElite/blob/main/best.pt) file provided.
4. Adjust the path of 'Output folder'.
